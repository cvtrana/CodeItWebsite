Welcome to My Website
Thank you for visiting my website! This website was created using HTML and Bootstrap. I created this website to get hand on experience on css framework(bootstrap)

Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a front-end web development framework that provides a consistent look and feel for websites. It includes pre-designed components such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars, as well as a grid system for laying out content. Using Bootstrap allows for faster development and a more responsive design that adjusts to various screen sizes.

HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It consists of a series of elements that define the structure and content of a webpage. HTML elements are represented by tags, which are written in angle brackets.

I hope you enjoy exploring my website! Thank you for stopping by.
